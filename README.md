#Ember Contact Management#

##Why?##

This is a sample project. Its intent is to explore some common scenarios of a web application. This is a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript only project with the concept UI which will be used as base to the client-server implementation, which will be in a different repository (it will be linked when the repo is up).

##WIP##

Please note that this the very first version and it's still work in progress. The concept UI should suffer minor changes in the future.
