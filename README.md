#Ember Contact Management#

##Why?##

This is a sample project. Its intent is to explore some common scenarios of a web application. This is a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript project with the concept UI used in [Ember-Contact-Management-WebAPI](https://github.com/MilkyWayJoe/Ember-Contact-Management-WebAPI).

##WIP##

Please note that this the very first version and it's still work in progress. The concept UI should suffer minor changes in the future.
